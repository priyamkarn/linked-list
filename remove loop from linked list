unordered_map<Node*,int>ump;
        Node *ptr=head;
        Node *prev;
        while(ptr)
        {
            if(ump.find(ptr)!=ump.end())
            {
                prev->next=NULL;
                break;
            }
            ump[ptr]=ptr->data;
            prev=ptr;
            ptr=ptr->next;
        }
    }
    The reason we set prev->next = NULL instead of curr->next = NULL is that we want to break the link between the previous node and the current node,
    which is the node that is repeated and causing the loop.
    By setting prev->next = NULL, we are effectively breaking the link and removing the loop.
